# BatVision: Learning to See 3D Spatial Layout with Two Ears
Collection of synchronized binaural echos and depth images of office scenes. 

## Update 2022: We are working on combining Batvision with a larger dataset, to be released within the next months. Due to review times of conferences and work going into creating the new data we predict release of the dataset end of 2022 and a paper pushing this research direction using the data beginning of 2023. This is not abandoned and we apologize for the heavy delay.

## Note: A bugfix was added in an effort to make the code compatible to be used with Data Distributed Parallel however there is no long term experience with using DDP with this code so please report issues if you find bugs.
