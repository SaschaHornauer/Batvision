# BatVision: Learning to See 3D Spatial Layout with Two Ears
Collection of synchronized binaural echos and depth images of office scenes. 

In the very near future, instructions how to download and use the dataset will become available here.

## Note: A bugfix was added in an effort to make the code compatible to be used with Data Distributed Parallel however there is no long term experience with using DDP with this code so please report issues if you find bugs.
